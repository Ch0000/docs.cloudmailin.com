# Email Forwarding
Email forwarding allows you to receive CloudMailin email to your own domain name such as example@yourdomain.com. Forwarding has to be set up at your domain registrar.

This guide will contain examples to help demonstrate setting up email forwarding on different hosts. To contribute to the document please contact us or edit it yourself on [github](http://github.com/cloudmailin).
