# Receiving Email with Python

## Django

[Jeremy Carbaugh](https://github.com/jcarbaugh) at Sunlight Foundation constructed a Django client for CloudMailin's original format so that you can use CloudMailin to receive email easily from within your Django Apps.

The code and usage examples are up on [Github](https://github.com/CloudMailin/django-cloudmailin) so we suggest you take a look and try it out for yourself!

For this reason we decided to make our documentation system available on [Github](http://github.com/cloudmailin/docs.cloudmailin.com).
Please help us and the other people using your language out and contribute some examples and send us a pull request!
